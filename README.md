A unified passport of “stamps!” from your beloved brands collected at unique locations.

## Tech Stack :

We have created a mobile first web experience keeping in mind how a web first experience can help in mass adoption. The website is built using NextJs.

Flow blockchain's unique architecture and features make it well-suited for handling the high transaction volume and scalability required for a mass adoption app centered around NFTs.

We leverage the Niftory APIs to create a seamless walletless onboarding experience where the user is given a social login option and we create a wallet for them on the fly. Niftory APIs are also used to mint and transfer NFTs to the user’s wallet

We are using nested NFTs on the unique network to create geo-tagged NFTs. Every parent NFT has nested child NFTs, these child NFTs are associated with the benefits that every brand provides. Once these benefits are claimed these child NFTs are marked as claimed.
